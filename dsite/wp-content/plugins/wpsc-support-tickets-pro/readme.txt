== Description ==

[wpsc Support Tickets](http://wpstorecart.com/wpsc-support-tickets/ "wpsc Support Tickets") is an open source Wordpress support ticket system.  
This isn't some port of another ticket system that's been hacked to run inside Wordpress.  This is a new plugin designed from the ground up specifically for Wordpress.

Support tickets are critical to most businesses that provide a product or service, 
and is often used for clients, customers, members, authors, sponsors, pre-sale questions and more.   

For full documentation, support, addons, and related tools, visit [our site](http://wpstorecart.com/wpsc-support-tickets/ "our site")

While completely optional, wpsc Support Tickets can work in unison with [wpStoreCart](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wpstorecart/ "wpStoreCart"), an open source ecommerce plugin for Wordpress.
This can optionally allow you to keep your support ticket system accessible only to paying customers and/or current members.

**Hightlighted Features:**

 * Users can create support tickets and reply to their own tickets
 * Guests can use tickets as well, using just their email address.  Disabled by default.
 * Admins, and any user granted the manage_wpsc_support_tickets capability, can reply to, close, or delete any ticket
 * Front end support ticket interface is done in jQuery, and utilizes Ajax ticket loading
 * Customizable departments, email messages, and CSS for custom solutions
 * You can hide support ticket capabilities from a user who has not purchased a specific product (requires [wpStoreCart](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wpstorecart/ "wpStoreCart") 2.4.9 or higher)
 * Seamless integration with open source wpStoreCart ecommerce plugin, including a shared Guest system 
 * Admin dashboard widget shows all open tickets
 * Both the admin and frontend provides a WYSIWYG HTML editor for formatting
 * Available in 15 languages
 * i18n ready and compatible (POT file included in the /languages/ directory)
