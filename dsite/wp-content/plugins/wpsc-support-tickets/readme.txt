== Description ==

[IDB Support Tickets](http://indiedevbundle.com/app/idb-ultimate-wordpress-bundle/#idbsupporttickets "IDB Support Tickets") (formerly wpsc Support Tickets) is an open source Wordpress support ticket system.  
This isn't some port of another ticket system that's been hacked to run inside Wordpress.  This is a new plugin designed from the ground up specifically for Wordpress.

Support tickets are critical to most businesses that provide a product or service, 
and is often used for clients, customers, members, authors, sponsors, pre-sale questions and more.   

For full documentation, support, addons, and related tools, visit [our site](http://indiedevbundle.com/app/idb-ultimate-wordpress-bundle/#idbsupporttickets "our site")

While completely optional, IDB Support Tickets can work in unison with [IDB Ecommerce](http://indiedevbundle.com/app/idb-ultimate-wordpress-bundle/ "IDB Ecommerce"), an open source ecommerce plugin for Wordpress.

 * Front end support ticket interface is done in jQuery, and utilizes Ajax ticket loading
 * New robust customizable ajax departments
 * Individual, department lead, and department wide email support on a department by department basis.
 * Customizable email messages, and CSS for custom solutions
 * Save any support ticket to PDF for easy printing
 * You can hide support ticket capabilities from a user who has not purchased a specific product (requires [IDB Ecommerce](http://indiedevbundle.com/app/idb-ultimate-wordpress-bundle/ "IDB Ecommerce") 2.4.9 or higher)
 * Seamless integration with open source IDB Ecommerce ecommerce plugin, including a shared Guest system 
 * Admin dashboard widget shows all open tickets

== Installation ==

The recommended way to install wpsc Support Tickets is to go into the Wordpress admin panel, and click on Add New under the 
Plugins menu.  Search for wpsc Support Tickets, and then click on Install, then click Install Now.  Once the installation 
completes, Activate the plugin

Or, if you want to install manually:

1. Download the wpsc-Support-Tickets.zip file
1. Extract the zip file to your hard drive, using a 7-zip or your archiver of choice.
1. Upload the `/wpsc-support-tickets/` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Create a new page, call it something like Support Tickets
1. Inside this page, place this shortcode only: [IDBSupportTickets]
1. Visit the wpsc Support Tickets admin page and select a "mainpage" for wpsc Support Tickets to use, like the Support Tickets page we told you to create

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q. My bbPress menus all disappeared! How can I get them back? =
The fix is to deactivate wpsc Support Tickets, go into bbPress settings at wp-admin > Settings > Forums > and then uncheck the "Automatically give registered visitors the XXXX forum role" and save your settings. Once you've saved the settings, now just recheck the "Automatically give registered visitors the XXXX forum role" and save. Now reactivate wpsc Support Tickets and it should work perfectly with bbPress. 

= Q. I have other questions, where can I find answers? =
